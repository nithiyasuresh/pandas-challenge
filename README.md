# pandas-challenge

Reading through the Heroes of Pymoli assignment, noted down in a notepad of the steps to be done.
Following the instructions, and created a new github repo for pandas assignment and named it pandas-challenge.
Cloned the repo to my laptop, so i can do regular commits from the folder into github.
Then created a folder for the assignment.  Did the pyschools by mistake first time around, and then deleted and created heroes of pymoli folder.
Copied across the Resources and the jupyter panda file into the github folder.
Did a commit to github, so the csv and panda file is stored into the github as a start.

When starting the assignment, first step was to import os, pandas, csv.
Assign a dataframe and define where the csv should be loaded from.
Read the csv file, and run the dataframe to load the file.

First step is to do a player count from the dataframe.
assign a name to find the total players. Using "unique" returned all the string in the column.
We needed the numbers to be returned, and so googling it, I found nunique, that returns the no of players rather than the name of players.
Created a dataframe, and give a column name "Total Players", and data to be picked up from "total_players" variable.
Finally displaying the dataframe, the display matched with the expected output.
